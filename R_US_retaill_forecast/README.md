# US Retail Sales Project

### Project's Purpose

The purpose of this project is to

- use a times series trend and linear regression to predict the 2024, 2025, and 2026 retail sales of the United States. Use accuracy measures and a residuals vs. predictions plot to further assess the validity of the model.
- if the data is available, investigate how retail sales correlates with inflation, housing prices, interest rates, and the GDP.

### Why Retail Sales Matters

Sarah Fenwick, a journalist at Admirals in the UK, explains the crucial role of retail sales in the economies of the United States and Great Britain. She explained that investors and financial analysts study consumer spending to help them make make decisions. Retail sales make up a good part of comsumer spending. The total retail sales in the us tracks consumer demand on finished goods. If retail sales go down, so does a state's tax revenues. Fenwick declared that, "inflation is the most important indicator linked to retail sales and overall consumer spending" (2024). She also mentioned that about 70 percent of the United States GDP comes from consumer spending.

Akrur Barua, an economist and Associate Vice President of Deloitte Services India, shares a detailed analysis of retail sales and inflation. He said that even though retail sales continues to grow after recovering rapidly from the Covid-19 slump, inflation and high home prices will likely reduce the purchasing power of American consumers. He referenced a recent survey which shows that many individuals plan on delaying large purchases, such buying a home (2022).
