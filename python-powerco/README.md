# PowerCo Prices and Customer Churn

### Project's Purpose

This is a project comlpeted in a Forage job simulation for Boston Consulting Group. I'm actually still working on completing part 3. I was tasked with helping a utility company, PowerCo, find out why some of their customers were leaving them for other power companies. PowerCo wanted to know how much does price affect a customerâ€™s decision to switch to another utility company.
