# U.S. Presidents Matching Game

### Project's Purpose

After having completed a bachelor's degree in history, and having taught United States history in high school, I decided it would be fun to try a game that will actually help you learn. Also, of course, another purpose of this project is to show my skills in JavaScript DOM manipulation on the front end. This was a fun project to work on, becuase the end result is beautiful, and it's pretty fun to play.
