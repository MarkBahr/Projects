# Needs to be Fixed / Questions about C++ Performance Assessment

1. I don't recognize for loops with arrows. Is that allowed in C++? 
2. For loops have this syntax:

	for (initialExpression; conditionExpression; updateExpression) {
		// do this
	}

3. I think there are a lot of things I didn't understand about C++ when I initially started this project.
So, I'd like to learn a lot, and practice making things, especially applications with C++, perhaps buy & follow a Udemy course.

- Learn how to start a C++ project in visual studio.
- Learn what type of project you'll need for the student project.

4. For practice, the location of the C++ console project is C:\Users\Admin\source\repos, called ConsoleApplication1
