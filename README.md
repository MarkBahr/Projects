# Novice or In Progress Projects

See my other repositories for more complete work. This is a collection of either beginner projects in software development or "in progress" projects in data science. Projects in this collection are either just starting, partially complete, or complete but have not been worked on for years. Tools used include SQL, R, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Chart.JS.
